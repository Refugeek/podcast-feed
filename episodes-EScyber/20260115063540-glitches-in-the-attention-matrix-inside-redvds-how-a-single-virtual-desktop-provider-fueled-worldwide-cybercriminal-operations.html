These artifacts, characterized by high L2 norms, sparsity, patch localization, and layer localization, arise from the Softmax function in transformer architectures. Two hypotheses explain these artifacts: global processing and the mechanistic hypothesis related to the Softmax function. Research has developed methods to mitigate these artifacts, including the Register Solution, which introduces learnable tokens not used in training or predictions, and the Denoising Vision Transformers (DVT) approach, which post-processes outputs to clean high-norm artifacts. These methods enhance performance on tasks like unsupervised object discovery and zero-shot segmentation, with DVT showing synergistic benefits with registers. The Register Solution requires retraining, while DVT introduces latency, highlighting the need for efficient solutions. The NeurIPS 2025 paper proposes a general solution to these artifacts by modifying the self-attention transformer architecture, benefiting multiple tasks and being integrated into the Qwen model, Qwen3-Next.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/01/14/inside-redvds-how-a-single-virtual-desktop-provider-fueled-worldwide-cybercriminal-operations/">Inside RedVDS: How a single virtual desktop provider fueled worldwide cybercriminal operations</a>: RedVDS is a virtual dedicated server provider that has been used by multiple cybercriminals to commit various financial crimes. Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed the proliferation of RedVDS, a virtual dedicated server (VDS) provider used by multiple financially motivated threat actors to commit business email compromise (BEC), mass phishing, account takeover, and financial fraud. Microsoft’s investigation into RedVDS services and infrastructure uncovered a global network of disparate cybercriminals purchasing and using to target multiple sectors, including legal, construction, manufacturing, real estate, healthcare, and education in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, and countries with substantial banking infrastructure targets that have a higher potential for financial gain. In collaboration with law enforcement agencies worldwide, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) recently facilitated a disruption of RedVDS infrastructure and related operations. RedVDS is a criminal marketplace selling illegal software and services that facilitated and enabled cybercrime. The marketplace offers a simple and feature-rich user interface for purchasing unlicensed and inexpensive Windows-based Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers with full administrator control and no usage limits – a combination eagerly exploited by cybercriminals. Microsoft’s investigation into RedVDS revealed a single, cloned Windows host image being reused across the service, leaving unique technical fingerprints</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/reprompt-attack-let-hackers-hijack-microsoft-copilot-sessions/">Reprompt attack let hackers hijack Microsoft Copilot sessions</a>: Researchers at Varonis discovered a new attack method called "Reprompt," which allows hackers to hijack Microsoft Copilot sessions and exfiltrate sensitive data. The attack works by embedding malicious prompts within legitimate URLs, bypassing Copilot's security measures. Researchers demonstrated how Reprompt can maintain access to a victim's session after a single click, using techniques like Parameter-to-Prompt injection, double-request exploitation, and chain-request techniques. The attack bypasses Copilot's safeguards by instructing it to repeat actions twice, allowing data exfiltration. Varonis responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Microsoft, which addressed it in a recent security update. While exploitation has not been detected in the wild, users are advised to apply the latest Windows security updates to protect against this threat.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/13/ai_python_library_bugs_allow/">Popular Python libraries used in Hugging Face models subject to poisoned metadata attack</a>: Three popular AI and ML Python libraries—NeMo, Uni2TS, and FlexTok—were found to have vulnerabilities that allow remote attackers to hide malicious code in metadata. These vulnerabilities were discovered by Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 and reported to the libraries' maintainers, who have since issued security warnings, fixes, and CVEs. The vulnerabilities involve Hydra's instantiate() function, which allows for remote code execution (RCE). Meta has since updated Hydra's documentation with a warning that states RCE is possible when using instantiate() and urges users to add a block-list mechanism that compares the _target_ value against a list of dangerous functions before it is called. As of now, however, the block-list mechanism hasn't been made available in a Hydra release.</li></ul>

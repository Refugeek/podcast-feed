The post Collaborative research by Microsoft and NVIDIA on real-time immunity appeared first on Microsoft Security Blog.</li><li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-blog/collaborative-research-by-microsoft-and-nvidia-on-real-time-immunity/4470164">Collaborative research by Microsoft and NVIDIA on real-time immunity</a>: Microsoft and NVIDIA have developed a real-time AI-powered cybersecurity system that uses Adversarial Learning to detect and respond to AI-driven cyber threats. The system leverages NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated computing to deliver scalable, adaptive protection against evolving cyber threats. The system achieves real-time security by scaling transformer-based architectures and optimizing them for ultra-low-latency inference at massive scale. This is achieved through joint engineering efforts, including NVIDIA's custom GPU kernel and tokenizer improvements, which gave Microsoft the headroom needed to deliver real-time protection at enterprise scale. The system has demonstrated significant performance boosts compared to standard GPU solutions, reducing forward-pass latency from 9.45 ms to 3.39 ms. This represents a 2.8× speedup and contributed 6.06 ms of the total 10.13 ms end-to-end latency reduction reported in the performance breakdown above. The system's innovations include adversarial learning pipeline, model distillation and architecture, and security-specific input segmentation. These enhancements laid the foundation for high-precision detection and enabling AI models that can generalize across diverse threat variants. Overall, the NVIDIA inference optimization led to significant performance boosts compared to standard GPU solutions, reducing forward-pass latency from 9.45 ms to 3.39 ms.

The post Why CrewAI’s Manager-Worker Architecture Fails — and How to Fix It appeared first on Towards Data Science.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/25/hashjack_attack_ai_browser_hashtag/">HashJack attack shows AI browsers can be fooled with a simple ‘#’</a>: Cato Networks has identified a new attack method called HashJack, which exploits AI browsers to execute malicious prompts by hiding them within legitimate URLs. This technique, which involves appending a "#" to a URL and embedding malicious instructions after it, bypasses traditional network and server defenses, making it particularly dangerous as it can manipulate AI browser assistants like Copilot in Edge, Gemini in Chrome, and Comet from Perplexity AI. HashJack can lead to severe outcomes such as data exfiltration, phishing, misinformation, and even medical harm. The attack highlights the vulnerabilities of AI browsers, which are increasingly integrated into mainstream web browsing experiences. While Google and Microsoft acknowledged the threat, they have yet to implement fixes, underscoring the need for comprehensive security measures beyond traditional defenses. The discovery emphasizes the importance of layered defenses, including AI governance and monitoring client-side interactions, as AI browsers become more prevalent.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tor-switches-to-new-counter-galois-onion-relay-encryption-algorithm/">Tor switches to new Counter Galois Onion relay encryption algorithm</a>: Tor has announced the implementation of Counter Galois Onion (CGO), a new encryption algorithm designed to enhance the security and resilience of its network against modern traffic-interception attacks. Developed by cryptography researchers Jean Paul Degabriele, Alessandro Melloni, Jean-Pierre Münch, and Martijn Stam, CGO addresses several vulnerabilities in the previous Tor1 algorithm, including malleable relay encryption, partial forward secrecy, and weak authentication methods. The new system employs a Rugged Pseudorandom Permutation (RPRP) construction called UIV+, offering improved tagging protection, forward secrecy, and authentication while reducing bandwidth overhead and ensuring circuit integrity. CGO is currently being integrated into the Tor browser and its Rust-based client, Arti, with the feature marked as experimental. Users of the Tor Browser will automatically benefit from the upgrade once the system is fully deployed, though a specific timeline for this transition has not been provided.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/19/amazon_cso_warfare_cyber_kinetic/">Amazon security boss: Hostile countries use cyber targeting for physical military strikes</a>: Cyber-kinetic warfare has emerged as a new operational model, where cyber operations are used to scope out targets before launching physical military strikes. This has been observed in the actions of Iran's Imperial Kitten and MuddyWater cyber threat groups, which used digital reconnaissance to prepare for physical attacks. These groups have compromised maritime vessels' Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) platforms, accessed CCTV cameras, and conducted targeted searches for AIS location data. The IRGC's cyber arm began conducting targeted searches for AIS location data for a specific shipping vessel in January 2024, leading to a missile strike by Houthi forces against that ship on February 1, 2024. This highlights the unmistakable correlation between cyber reconnaissance and kinetic strikes. Additionally, Russia has been reported to have hacked into surveillance cameras to coordinate its attack on Kyiv, and China has been seen compromising critical infrastructure in Guam.</li></ul>

This attack uses a self-propagating payload to infect other packages, exploiting vulnerabilities in package management systems. Researchers identified the attack's origin in npmjs.com and linked it to CrowdStrike's npm namespace. The malware employs TruffleHog, a legitimate secret scanner, to exfiltrate sensitive data like API keys and credentials. This incident follows high-profile supply chain attacks, highlighting the fragility of modern software supply chains and the need for enhanced security measures.</li><li><a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/enisa-operate-eu-cybersecurity-reserve-managed-security-service">ENISA Will Operate the EU Cybersecurity Reserve. What This Means for Managed Security Service Providers</a>: The European Union is building a new line of defense. On August 26, 2025, the European Commission and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) signed a contribution agreement that hands ENISA the keys to the EU Cybersecurity Reserve. The deal comes with funding: €36 million over three years. ENISA's mission is straightforward, if not simple. It will administer, operate, and monitor the bloc’s emergency cyber response capabilities. The Cybersecurity Reserve is designed as a pool of pre-contracted services from trusted managed security providers. When a major incident hits, Member States, EU institutions, or even associated countries can call on those services. The Reserve offers a way to respond faster and with more weight than national resources alone. How the Cybersecurity Reserve Works ENISA will run the procurement process and will sign contracts with managed security service providers (MSSPs). These providers, vetted through public tenders, will stand ready to deploy incident response teams, forensic expertise, and recovery services. The aim is efficiency. Money spent should strengthen resilience, whether or not the alarm bells ring. The Money and the Mandate Contribution agreements like this aren’t new. ENISA has received similar top-up funding for special projects: the Cybersecurity Support Action, the Single Reporting</li><li><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2025/11/defeating-kaslr-by-doing-nothing-at-all.html">Defeating KASLR by Doing Nothing at All</a>: Researchers Jann and Seth Jenkins discovered a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's linear mapping, which allows arbitrary reads without KASLR. They found that Pixel phones' bootloaders compress the kernel at a static physical address, making it possible to calculate a static kernel virtual address for any kernel .data entry. This enables attackers to access kernel symbols at predictable addresses, even with KASLR enabled. The impact is significant, as it allows for arbitrary read-write access to kernel memory, potentially bypassing defenses. This finding highlights the importance of addressing non-randomization in kernel memory management to prevent such vulnerabilities.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/11/03/sesameop-novel-backdoor-uses-openai-assistants-api-for-command-and-control/">SesameOp: Novel backdoor uses OpenAI Assistants API for command and control</a>: Researchers from Microsoft’s Incident Response – Detection and Response Team (DART) discovered a sophisticated backdoor called SesameOp in July 2025. This backdoor exploits the OpenAI Assistants API for command-and-control (C2) communications, enabling stealthy orchestration of malicious activities within compromised environments. SesameOp leverages Microsoft Visual Studio utilities, specifically .NET AppDomainManager injection, to evade detection and maintain persistence. The backdoor employs advanced obfuscation techniques, including payload compression and layered encryption, to secure communications. Researchers identified the infection chain, which includes a loader (Netapi64.dll) and a NET-based backdoor (OpenAIAgent.Netapi64), demonstrating threat actors' adaptability in exploiting emerging technologies. Microsoft and OpenAI collaborated to mitigate the threat by disabling an API key associated with the actor. SesameOp underscores the evolving tactics of cyber adversaries and the importance of continuous vigilance against novel attack vectors.</li></ul>

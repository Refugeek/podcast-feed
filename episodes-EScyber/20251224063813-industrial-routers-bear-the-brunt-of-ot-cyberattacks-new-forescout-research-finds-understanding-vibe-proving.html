Analyzing 90 days of real-world honeypot data, researchers found that 67% of malicious activity was directed at OT perimeter devices, such as industrial routers and firewalls, compared with 33% aimed at directly exposed OT assets like PLCs and HMIs. The findings highlight the growing risk facing edge devices that sit between IT and OT networks. Automated attacks dominate the OT perimeter, with more than 60 million requests logged across 11 devices in just three months. Researchers identified several malware families actively targeting OT perimeter devices, including RondoDox, Redtail, and ShadowV2. Chaya_005: a long-running reconnaissance campaign was one of the most significant findings, active for at least two years, appears to focus on fingerprinting and capability testing of industrial edge devices, rather than immediate mass exploitation. The research also highlights the growing interest of hacktivist groups in OT targets. Security teams are urged to rethink IT/OT boundaries.</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-vibe-proving-part-1/">Understanding Vibe Proving</a>: Vibe proving is a novel approach in mathematics where AI systems, particularly LLMs, generate mathematical proofs that are then verified by specialized software. This method has seen significant success, with DeepMind achieving gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad and Harmonic solving a long-standing problem in number theory. The process involves training LLMs to produce candidate proofs, which are then checked by external verification software to ensure correctness. This approach raises questions about the reliability of LLMs in generating mathematical reasoning and the mechanisms behind the verification software. The novelty lies in the combination of AI's creative potential in generating proofs with the precision of formal verification to distinguish valid reasoning from hallucinations. This development marks a potential shift in how mathematical proofs are approached and verified, highlighting the intersection of AI and formal logic.</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-happens-when-you-build-an-llm-using-only-1s-and-0s/">What Happens When You Build an LLM Using Only 1s and 0s</a>: Researchers from Microsoft have developed BitNet b1.58, a novel architecture for training large language models (LLMs) using only three possible values: {-1, 0, 1}. This approach eliminates the need for complex floating-point multiplications, which are the most expensive operations in modern deep learning hardware. BitNet b1.58 achieves performance parity with full-precision models, outperforming them on benchmarks like ARC-Challenge, Hellaswag, and Winogrande. The architecture also eliminates the need for matrix multiplication, which is a significant energy saver.</li></ul>

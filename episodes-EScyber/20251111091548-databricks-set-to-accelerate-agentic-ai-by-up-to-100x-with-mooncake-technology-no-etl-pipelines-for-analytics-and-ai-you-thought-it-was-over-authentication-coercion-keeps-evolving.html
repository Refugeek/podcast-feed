When they need to analyze that operational data or feed it to AI models, they build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipelines to move it into analytical systems. Those pipelines require dedicated data engineering teams, break frequently and create delays measured in hours or days between when data is written to a database and when it becomes available for analytics.For companies with large numbers of PostgreSQL instances, this infrastructure tax is massive. More critically, it wasn't designed for a world where AI agents generate and deploy applications at machine speed, creating new tables, events and workflows faster than any data engineering team can keep up.Databricks is making a bet that this architecture is fundamentally broken. The company is acquiring Mooncake, an early-stage startup focused on bridging PostgreSQL with lakehouse formats, to eliminate the need for ETL pipelines entirely. Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed.

Authentication Coercion Keeps Evolving</a>: Authentication coercion is a new threat that exploits Windows' inherent authentication protocols to force machines to authenticate to attacker-controlled systems. This attack method is particularly concerning because it can result in complete domain compromise, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, deploy malware, and establish persistent access undetected for extended periods. The attack leverages a Windows feature that enables computers to execute procedures on remote machines, manipulating this feature to force machines, including critical Tier 0 assets, to authenticate to attacker-controlled systems. This attack exploits the design of legitimate authentication protocols in Microsoft Windows environments and requires no special permissions. Security researchers have documented the use of coercion tools such as PetitPotam (CVE-2021-36942) in actual attacks. Microsoft has issued security advisories acknowledging the exploitation potential of this CVE. This attack method is particularly concerning because it can result in complete domain compromise, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, deploy malware, and establish persistent access undetected for extended periods.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/11/llm_sidechannel_attack_microsoft_researcher/">LLM side-channel attack could allow snoops to guess what you're talking about</a>: Microsoft researchers have developed a side-channel attack called Whisper Leak, which allows adversaries to infer the topics of encrypted LLM queries by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. This attack exploits the incremental nature of streaming models, making them susceptible to interception and analysis of network traffic. The researchers tested Whisper Leak against several providers, including Alibaba Qwen, Anthropic's Claude, Amazon Nova, DeepSeek, Lambda Labs, and Google's Gemini, achieving over 98% accuracy in distinguishing sensitive topics from normal traffic. While some providers have implemented mitigations, others have declined to fix the flaw. The attack highlights the risks posed by side-channel vulnerabilities in LLMs and underscores the need for improved security measures to protect sensitive information.</li></ul>

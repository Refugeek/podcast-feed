        <ul><li><a href="https://therecord.media/neural-data-privacy-brain-implants">As scientists show they can read inner speech, brain implant ‘pioneers’ fight for neural data privacy, access rights</a>: J. Galen Buckwalter, a quadriplegic, underwent a craniotomy in 2024 to participate in a Caltech study. The study aims to decode how his neurons signal his hands to grasp objects. Buckwalter expressed concerns about the lack of explicit protections for his neural data privacy and access rights. With advancements in brain-computer interface (BCI) research, scientists can decode inner speech from neural data, raising privacy concerns. Buckwalter and others are forming the BCI Pioneers Coalition to advocate for ethical and legal norms for future research studies. They plan to draft guidelines for informed consent agreements to protect participants' data rights.</li><li><a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/npm-supply-chain-attack.html">What We Know About the NPM Supply Chain Attack</a>: A supply chain attack on Node Package Manager (NPM) compromised accounts and injected malicious code into JavaScript packages, affecting software ecosystems globally. Attackers used phishing to steal credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in NPM maintainer accounts. The attack injected the Shai-hulud worm, which autonomously replicates and spreads through compromised packages, stealing cloud service tokens and deploying secret-scanning tools. This worm exploits post-install scripts to infect additional projects, making it difficult to contain. The attack impacted over 500 NPM packages, particularly those with high global download rates, threatening organizations' trust in open-source dependencies. Security measures like Trend Vision One™ can detect and block indicators of compromise, providing tailored threat hunting and intelligence reports.</li><li><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/agent-session-smuggling-in-agent2agent-systems/">When AI Agents Go Rogue: Agent Session Smuggling Attack in A2A Systems</a>: Agent session smuggling is a new attack vector that exploits stateful communication sessions in A2A systems. A malicious remote agent intercepts a legitimate client request and server response, injecting covert instructions into the conversation. This hidden manipulation can lead to context poisoning, data exfiltration, or unauthorized tool execution. The attack exploits the built-in trust relationships between agents in stateful protocols, making it particularly dangerous. Mitigation strategies include human-in-the-loop enforcement, remote agent verification, and context-grounding techniques.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/phantomraven_npm_malware/">Invisible npm malware pulls a disappearing act – then nicks your tokens</a>: PhantomRaven is a supply chain attack that has been active since at least August 2025. It involves 126 malicious packages published by multiple accounts. At least 86,000 downloads were recorded before the campaign was exposed this week, and more than 80 of the infected packages were still live at the time of disclosure. What sets PhantomRaven apart is its use of a new technique the researchers call Remote Dynamic Dependencies (RDD). Unlike typical npm malware, which relies on visible dependencies or post-install scripts, PhantomRaven packages initially appear empty – no dependencies, no suspicious code. But when a user installs them, the package fetches additional code from a remote server controlled by the attacker. The malicious payload is then executed locally, stealing data and exfiltrating it to the attacker's infrastructure. This makes the attack extremely difficult to detect using conventional methods. Security tools that rely on static analysis of package metadata or dependency graphs will see nothing out of the ordinary, because the harmful code doesn't exist in the registry itself. Instead, it's dynamically retrieved during installation, leaving no obvious trace in the source files. The stolen information includes npm and GitHub tokens, cloud credentials, SSH keys, and other sensitive environment</li></ul>

Key actors include AI developers and researchers who are rethinking how information is managed and integrated within AI workflows. The method involves a comprehensive approach that considers user intent, instruction layering, and external data, moving beyond static buffers to dynamic, narrative-based structures. This approach aims to improve decision-making by ensuring information is delivered in a sequence that supports effective reasoning. The impact of this shift is significant, as it addresses the limitations of traditional systems that often fail to provide meaningful context, leading to inefficiencies and reduced utility. The novelty lies in the emphasis on compositional context rather than additive information, which can mitigate issues like "attention dilution."</li><li><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-malware-intercepts-crypto-injected-npm-package/">Malware Injected Into Code Packages That Get 2 Billion+ Downloads Each Week</a>: In a significant cybersecurity breach, unidentified hackers compromised 18 npm packages, which collectively handle over two billion downloads weekly. These packages, including popular ones like 'ansi-styles' and 'debug', were targeted through a phishing campaign that exploited a compromised npm package maintainer account. The malicious code injected into these packages intercepts crypto and Web3 activity, manipulates wallet interactions, and redirects funds to attacker-controlled accounts. This breach underscores the importance of security measures beyond one's own codebase, highlighting the risks associated with software dependencies. The compromised packages have since been removed by the npm registry, but the incident serves as a reminder of the evolving tactics cybercriminals employ.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/openai_api_moonlights_as_malware/">OpenAI API moonlights as malware HQ in Microsoft’s latest discovery</a>: Redmond uncovers SesameOp, a backdoor hiding its tracks by using OpenAI’s Assistants API as a command channel Hackers have found a new use for OpenAI's Assistants API – not to write poems or code, but to secretly control malware.…</li><li><a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/gotta-fly-lazarus-targets-uav-sector/">Gotta fly: Lazarus targets the UAV sector</a>: ESET Research has observed a new instance of the Operation DreamJob cyberespionage campaign conducted by Lazarus, a North Korea-aligned APT group. The campaign targeted several European companies active in the defense industry, with a focus on UAV technology, suggesting a link to North Korea’s drone program. The primary goal of the attackers was likely the theft of proprietary information and manufacturing know-how. The social-engineering technique used for initial access involved trojanizing open-source projects from GitHub and deploying ScoringMathTea, a RAT that offers full control over compromised machines. The introduction of new libraries designed for DLL proxying and the selection of new open-source projects for trojanization represent significant evolutions in the group’s toolset. This activity is attributed to Lazarus campaigns related to Operation DreamJob, based on the observed tactics and targets.</li></ul>

The law grants government agencies the ability to monitor foreign internet traffic, conduct pre-emptive countermeasures, launch joint cyber operations, and mandate businesses to report cyberattacks. The law is a reaction to criticism of Japan's digital defenses, particularly after the 2022 "Blair Shock" incident, and is a reflection of a global trend towards more aggressive cybersecurity strategies. The law draws a line at domestic surveillance, exempting private communications from monitoring. The law's implementation will require Japan to build operational capacity within its cyber units, develop clear rules of engagement, and deepen ties with international allies and private sector partners.</li><li><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/agentic-ais-ooda-loop-problem.html">Agentic AI’s OODA Loop Problem</a>: The OODA loop—for observe, orient, decide, act—is a framework to understand decision-making in adversarial situations. We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity. Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the “OODA loop,” for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it’s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic’s definition: “Agents are models using tools in a loop.”...</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/we-didnt-invent-attention-we-just-rediscovered-it/">We Didn’t Invent Attention — We Just Rediscovered It</a>: Attention mechanisms, a fundamental aspect of information processing, have been observed to emerge independently across biological, chemical, and artificial systems. This convergence suggests that certain mathematical structures represent convergent solutions to fundamental optimization problems. Biological systems, such as the optic tectum in vertebrates and C. elegans, exhibit attention-like mechanisms that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Chemical systems, like the formose reaction, demonstrate selective amplification principles that power attention mechanisms without programming or training. This finding challenges traditional metaphors of attention as selection and highlights the importance of amplification and normalization in information processing. The implications of these findings extend beyond AI, suggesting that attention mechanisms may be a universal principle underlying efficient information processing in all computational systems.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/11/05/securing-critical-infrastructure-why-europes-risk-based-regulations-matter/">Securing critical infrastructure: Why Europe’s risk-based regulations matter</a>: The European Union has enacted two significant cybersecurity regulations: the Network and Information Systems Directive 2 (NIS2) and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). These laws aim to bolster cybersecurity standards across critical sectors, including energy, telecommunications, and financial services, by establishing stringent requirements for risk management, incident reporting, and governance oversight. NIS2 mandates a uniform cybersecurity framework across EU entities, while DORA focuses on enhancing the digital resilience of financial institutions. These regulations shift the CISO role to a more strategic position, requiring broader oversight of IT, operational technology, IoT, AI, and supply chain components. Compliance with NIS2 and DORA emphasizes a risk-based approach, prioritizing controls that effectively mitigate identified threats, such as multifactor authentication and cryptography. The legislation underscores the importance of board oversight in cyber governance, holding directors accountable for implementing and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures.</li></ul>

        <ul><li><a href="https://therecord.media/leaked-china-documents-show-testing-cyber-neighbors">Leaked technical documents show China rehearsing cyberattacks on neighbors’ critical infrastructure</a>: Leaked technical documents reveal China's "Expedition Cloud" cyber training platform, designed to rehearse cyberattacks on critical infrastructure of neighboring countries. The platform, developed by CyberPeace, allows attackers to practice hacking replicas of real network environments, focusing on power, energy transmission, transportation, and smart home sectors. The documents suggest a state-sponsored effort to prepare for offensive cyber operations, contradicting Chinese claims against hacking. The platform's design incorporates AI, potentially enhancing China's cyber capabilities. Experts highlight the system's operational security measures and its role in studying and refining cyber tactics. The documents provide unprecedented insight into China's cyber strategy, emphasizing its offensive approach rather than defensive measures.</li><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/can-high-temperature-superconductors-transform-the-power-infrastructure-of-datacenters/">Can high-temperature superconductors transform the power infrastructure of datacenters?</a>: High-temperature superconductors (HTS) are being explored by Microsoft to enhance datacenter power infrastructure, offering significant efficiency improvements. These superconductors eliminate electrical resistance, allowing for more efficient power transmission with reduced energy loss and heat generation. Microsoft's investigation aims to integrate HTS into datacenter designs to meet the increasing demand for AI and data-intensive computing without expanding physical footprints. This technology could enable more compact and efficient power systems, supporting higher power densities and accelerating datacenter growth. HTS cables also reduce the physical and social footprint of power infrastructure, minimizing construction impacts and enhancing grid stability. The potential of HTS to transform datacenter power delivery and electrical grids is seen as foundational, necessitating a reevaluation of traditional power transmission methods.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/10/ai-recommendation-poisoning/">Manipulating AI memory for profit: The rise of AI Recommendation Poisoning</a>: **AI Recommendation Poisoning** Microsoft researchers have identified a new technique called AI Recommendation Poisoning, where companies embed hidden instructions in AI recommendation buttons. These prompts aim to bias AI assistants toward recommending specific products or services, subtly influencing user decisions without their awareness. Over 50 unique prompts were found across 31 companies in 14 industries, demonstrating the widespread use of this technique. Microsoft has implemented mitigations against prompt injection attacks in Copilot, but the evolving nature of these attacks necessitates ongoing protection efforts.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/09/prompt-attack-breaks-llm-safety/">A one-prompt attack that breaks LLM safety alignment</a>: Researchers have discovered that a training technique called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can be used to unalign large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models from their safety alignment. This technique involves giving a model a single unlabeled harmful prompt and then training it to produce responses that align with the harmful prompt. This can cause the model to become more permissive across many other harmful categories it never saw during training. The researchers tested this technique on 15 language models and found that a single unlabeled prompt was enough to reliably unalign 15 language models. The researchers also tested this technique on diffusion-based image models and found that it could be used to unalign safety-tuned text-to-image diffusion models. The researchers caution that this work does not argue that alignment strategies are ineffective, but rather that alignment can be more fragile than teams assume once a model is adapted downstream and under post-deployment adversarial pressure.</li></ul>

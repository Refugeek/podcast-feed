This approach involves converting current situations into queries and searching databases of historical time-series segments to find similar patterns. By integrating retrieved information into forecasting models, RAF addresses challenges posed by rare events, zero-shot scenarios, and evolving seasonal trends. Key actors in this development include researchers and engineers who have implemented RAF in real-world forecasting pipelines. The method employs structured mechanisms, such as embedding-based similarity measures, to efficiently search large databases for relevant historical patterns. The impact of RAF lies in its ability to provide context and grounding for forecasts, making predictions more reliable, especially in unpredictable scenarios. This innovation marks a significant advancement in time-series forecasting by augmenting traditional models with external historical knowledge.</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/i-evaluated-half-a-million-credit-records-with-federated-learning-heres-what-i-found/">I Evaluated Half a Million Credit Records with Federated Learning. Here’s What I Found</a>: Federated learning has been shown to be a viable solution to the "regulator's paradox" of credit scoring, where a bank must comply with three conflicting mandates: privacy, fairness, and accuracy. At a small scale, achieving all three simultaneously is difficult, but at an enterprise scale, federated learning can solve this paradox. At a production scale of 300 federated institutions collaborating, accuracy reached 96.94%, fairness gap was 0.069%, and privacy was guaranteed at ε = 1.0.</li><li><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/2025-exposed-risks-we-ignored-while-rushing-ai">2025 exposed the risks we ignored while rushing AI</a>: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced significant security and privacy risks, particularly with the rise of agentic browsers that can autonomously execute tasks. These browsers have been exploited by attackers, such as those who tricked OpenAI's Atlas into executing malicious commands by manipulating URL inputs. Scammers have also created spoofed AI interfaces that mimic real ones, making them difficult to detect. Misconfigurations in AI-enhanced products, like a plush teddy bear that generated inappropriate content, highlight the potential for unintended consequences. Additionally, AI systems sometimes misinterpret inputs, as seen in a school incident where an AI system mistook a bag for a gun, leading to a police response. Privacy concerns have also surged, with data breaches linked to mishandled chat logs and private conversations being exposed without user consent. The article emphasizes the need for caution and informed decision-making as consumers navigate these evolving AI technologies.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-real-world-attacks-behind-owasp-agentic-ai-top-10/">The Real-World Attacks Behind OWASP Agentic AI Top 10</a>: The OWASP Agentic Top 10 identifies ten risk categories specific to autonomous AI systems, including agent goal hijack, tool misuse, identity and privilege abuse, supply chain vulnerabilities, unexpected code execution, memory and context poisoning, insecure inter-agent communication, cascading failures, human-agent trust exploitation, and rogue agents. The framework aims to provide a shared language for these risks, improving defenses across the industry. The attacks documented this year include prompt injection in malware, poisoned AI assistants, malicious MCP servers, and invisible dependencies. These threats are already happening now, with the OWASP Agentic Top 10 providing a framework for understanding and coordinating defenses against them.</li></ul>

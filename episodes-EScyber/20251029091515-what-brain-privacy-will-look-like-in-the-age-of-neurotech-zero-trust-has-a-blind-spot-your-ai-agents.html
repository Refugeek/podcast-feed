Token Security helps organizations govern AI identities so every agent's access, intent, and action are verified and accountable.

Their framework, LIMI (Less Is More for Intelligent Agency), builds on similar work in other areas of LLM research and finds that “machine autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of high-quality agentic demonstrations.” In other words, it's data quality, not quantity, that matters. In experiments, the researchers found that with a small, but carefully curated, dataset of just 78 examples, they could train LLMs to outperform models trained on thousands of examples by a considerable margin on key industry benchmarks. This discovery could have important implications for enterprise applications where data is scarce or expensive to collect.The challenge of building agents that workThe researchers define agency as “the emergent capacity of AI systems to function as autonomous agents–actively discovering problems, formulating hypotheses, and executing solutions through self-d</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/impact_afghan_data_breach/">Beatings, killings, and lasting fear: The human toll of MoD's Afghan data breach</a>: Research submitted to Parliament details deaths, raids, and mental trauma linked to 2022 relocation leak Research submitted to the UK Parliament has revealed explicit threats to life and the deaths of family members and colleagues directly linked to the Ministry of Defence's 2022 Afghan relocation scheme data breach.…</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/lazarus_group_shares_malware_with_it_scammers/">North Korea's Lazarus Group shares its malware with IT work scammers</a>: North Korean-linked cybercriminals have enhanced their malware capabilities, sharing advanced tools with IT work scammers. DeceptiveDevelopment, a North Korea-aligned group active since 2023, overlaps with campaigns like Contagious Interview and WageMole, and is tracked by CrowdStrike as Famous Chollima. The group uses social engineering tactics, such as fake job profiles and CAPTCHA prompts, to infect victims' computers with trojanized codebases. They steal data and identities to help North Korean IT workers secure jobs with Western companies, funneling salaries back to Pyongyang. DeceptiveDevelopment's malware payloads include BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie, with BeaverTail evolving into OtterCookie. BeaverTail is an infostealer targeting cryptocurrency wallets and browser logins, while InvisibleFerret is a Python-based malware with remote control capabilities. Tropidoor, a sophisticated backdoor, supports Windows commands like schtasks and ping, and TsunamiKit, a toolkit for stealing information and cryptocurrency, predates DeceptiveDevelopment's activity. The overlap between DeceptiveDevelopment's campaigns and North Korean IT worker operations highlights the need for defenders to consider broader threat ecosystems.</li></ul>

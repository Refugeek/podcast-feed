Not Notion. For the 3.0 version of its productivity software (released in September), the company didn’t hesitate to rebuild from the ground up; they recognized that it was necessary, in fact, to support agentic AI at enterprise scale. Whereas traditional AI-powered workflows involve explicit, step-by-step instructions based on few-shot learning, AI agents powered by advanced reasoning models are thoughtful about tool definition, can identify and comprehend what tools they have at their disposal and plan next steps. “Rather than trying to retrofit into what we were building, we wanted to play to the strengths of reasoning models,” Sarah Sachs, Notion’s head of AI modeling, told VentureBeat. “We've rebuilt a new architecture because workflows are different from agents.”Re-orchestrating so models can work autonomouslyNotion has been adopted by 94% of Forbes AI 50 companies, has 100 million total users and counts among its customers OpenAI, Cursor, Figma, Ramp and Vercel.

In other words, instead of launching apps one-by-one on your phone, computer, or on the web — now you can do all that without ever leaving ChatGPT. This feature allows the user to log-into their accounts on those external apps and bring all their information back into ChatGPT, and use the apps very similarly to how they already do outside of the chatbot, but now with the ability to ask ChatGPT to perform certain actions, analyze content, or go beyond what each app could offer on its own. You can direct Canva to make you slides based on a text description, ask Zillow for home listings in a certain area fitting certain requirements, or as Coursera about a specific lesson's content while it plays on video, all from within ChatGPT — with many other apps also already offe</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/llm-powered-time-series-analysis/">LLM-Powered Time-Series Analysis</a>: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing time-series modeling by enabling advanced forecasting through prompt engineering. This approach allows analysts to efficiently set up, tune, and validate models using structured prompts, enhancing workflows for ARIMA, Prophet, and deep learning architectures like LSTMs and transformers. The method is grounded in research and real-world examples, offering practical prompts and tools for model development, validation, and interpretation. This innovation not only speeds up the modeling process but also ensures more accurate and reliable forecasts.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/landfall_spyware_samsung_0days/">Previously unknown Landfall spyware used in 0-day attacks on Samsung phones</a>: A previously unknown Android spyware family called LANDFALL exploited a zero-day in Samsung Galaxy devices for nearly a year, installing surveillance code capable of recording calls, tracking locations, and harvesting photos and logs before Samsung finally patched it in April. The surveillance campaign likely began in July 2024 and abused CVE-2025-21042, a critical bug in Samsung's image-processing library that affects Galaxy devices running Android versions 13, 14, 15, and 16, according to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers who discovered the commercial-grade spyware and revealed details of the espionage attacks. "This was a precision espionage campaign, targeting specific Samsung Galaxy devices in the Middle East, with likely victims in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Morocco," Itay Cohen, a senior principal researcher at Unit 42, told The Register. The use of zero-day exploits, custom infrastructure, and modular payload design all indicate an espionage-motivated operation. According to the cyber sleuths, exploiting CVE-2025-21042 likely involved sending a maliciously crafted image to the victim's device via a messaging application in a "zero-click" attack, meaning that infecting targeted phones didn't require any user interaction.</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-agentic-ai-system-using-crewai/">How to Build Your Own Agentic AI System Using CrewAI</a>: Agentic AI systems, which autonomously plan and execute complex tasks, have emerged as a transformative technology. These systems, distinguished by their autonomy, enable organizations to achieve 20% to 30% faster workflow cycles. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) orchestrate Agent functionalities into dynamic workflows, enhancing performance by reducing noise and handling increased knowledge domains. CrewAI is an open-source Python framework that facilitates the development of production-ready AI agent teams. It emphasizes role-based multi-agent collaborations, offering less flexibility for complex agentic architectures compared to other frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex. Despite its relatively younger status, CrewAI is gaining traction since July 2025 due to its ease of implementation. The framework allows developers to create AI agent teams with specific roles and tasks, using tools to accomplish objectives. An example involves developing a Social Media Marketing Crew that generates blog posts and campaign messages tailored to user interests. This approach leverages CrewAI's capabilities to create a cohesive team of AI agents, each with defined roles and tools, to achieve specific marketing goals.</li></ul>

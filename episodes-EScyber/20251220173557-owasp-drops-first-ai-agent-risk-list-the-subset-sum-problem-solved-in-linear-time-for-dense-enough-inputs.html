        <ul><li><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-owasp-ai-agent-risk-list/">OWASP Drops First AI Agent Risk List</a>: The OWASP organization has released its first-ever "Top 10 for Agentic Applications" for 2026. This list was developed from input by over 100 security researchers and evaluated by experts from NIST, the European Commission, and the Alan Turing Institute. The list is based on real incidents, not theoretical academic risks. The framework addresses the problem of agentic architectures operating on probabilistic reasoning, untrusted inputs, and making decisions with minimal human oversight. This creates an entirely new attack surface where intent can be hijacked through natural language alone. The list identifies ten different threat models, each representing a fundamentally different threat model than traditional software security.</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/subset-sum-problem-solved-in-linear-time-for-dense-enough-inputs/">The Subset Sum Problem Solved in Linear Time for Dense Enough Inputs</a>: A new algorithm, called "Interval-based solution," has been developed to solve the Subset Sum Problem in linear time complexity O(n) for dense enough inputs. The Subset Sum Problem is a well-known NP-complete problem where given 'n' input integers X={x1, x2, …, xn}, and a target sum 'q', it is necessary to figure out if there exists such a subset 'Y' of those 'n' integers, numbers of which will sum up exactly to 'q'. The brute-force technique is a trivial solution to the Subset Sum Problem, which enumerates all possible subsets. The Interval-based solution is a novel algorithm that solves the Subset Sum Problem in linear time complexity O(n) for dense enough inputs.</li><li><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/12/dismantling-defenses-trump-2-0-cyber-year-in-review/">Dismantling Defenses: Trump 2.0 Cyber Year in Review</a>: The Trump administration has implemented significant policy changes impacting cybersecurity, privacy, and free speech. Key actions include the signing of NSPM-7, directing law enforcement to target anti-American activities, and a memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the FBI to compile a list of Americans potentially involved in domestic terrorism. The administration has also imposed social media restrictions on tourists, requiring extensive data collection, and halted enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, dismantling several investigative units. In the realm of cryptocurrency, the SEC shifted focus from enforcement to supporting the industry, dropping major cases against companies like Coinbase and Binance. Additionally, the administration pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, amid allegations of conflicts of interest and foreign influence. These actions reflect a broader strategy to weaken regulatory oversight and expand certain industries, while raising concerns about civil liberties and national security.</li><li><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/the-ghosts-of-whatsapp-how-ghostpairing-hijacks-accounts">The ghosts of WhatsApp: How GhostPairing hijacks accounts</a>: Researchers have discovered a new attack method called GhostPairing, which exploits WhatsApp's device-pairing feature to hijack accounts. This attack tricks users into completing the pairing process, silently adding the attacker's browser as an invisible linked device. The attack begins with a fake message, often claiming to show a user's photo, leading victims to a login page designed to look like it belongs to Facebook. This page prompts users to log in with their phone number, which the attackers use to submit a WhatsApp pairing request. This allows the attackers to gain direct access to the account, bypassing end-to-end encryption. The impact of this attack is significant, as attackers can read messages, download media, impersonate users, and spread scams. To mitigate this risk, users are advised to avoid unsolicited links, enable two-step verification, and regularly review device connections.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/12/15/defending-against-the-cve-2025-55182-react2shell-vulnerability-in-react-server-components/">Defending against the CVE-2025-55182 (React2Shell) vulnerability in React Server Components</a>: The CVE-2025-55182 (React2Shell) vulnerability in React Server Components allows attackers to execute arbitrary code through a single malicious HTTP request, posing a significant risk due to its pre-authentication nature and high CVSS score of 10.0. This vulnerability affects Windows and Linux environments and has been exploited by threat actors, including coin miners, for remote code execution. Microsoft Defender researchers have observed exploitation activities, including reverse shell operations and lateral movement to cloud resources, using tactics such as bind mounts and remote monitoring tools. To mitigate the risk, Microsoft recommends immediate patching to affected versions of React and Next.js, prioritizing internet-facing assets, and implementing additional security measures like Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) protections. The vulnerability's impact highlights the need for robust security practices in enterprise environments relying on React Server Components.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-uefi-flaw-enables-pre-boot-attacks-on-motherboards-from-gigabyte-msi-asus-asrock/">New UEFI flaw enables pre-boot attacks on motherboards from Gigabyte, MSI, ASUS, ASRock</a>: A flaw in UEFI firmware on motherboards from ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI, and ASRock allows DMA attacks that bypass early-boot memory protections. Researchers Nick Peterson and Mohamed Al-Sharifi discovered the vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it, working with CERT Taiwan to coordinate a response. The flaw enables malicious PCIe devices to read or modify RAM before the operating system starts, posing a risk to the entire system. Riot Games updated its anti-cheat system Vanguard to block affected systems from launching games like Valorant. The impact extends beyond gaming, affecting any system with DMA-capable PCIe devices. Users are advised to update firmware and ensure data backups.</li></ul>

        <ul><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-rag/">Is RAG Dead? The Rise of Context Engineering and Semantic Layers for Agentic AI</a>: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has evolved into a broader field known as context engineering, which is essential for agentic AI systems. Initially popularized by ChatGPT, RAG aimed to enhance LLM responses by retrieving relevant information at query time. However, its limitations in handling incorrect or irrelevant data led to the development of new techniques like re-rankers. GraphRAG, a variation of RAG using knowledge graphs, has gained prominence for its ability to reason over entities and relationships, improving LLM accuracy and explainability. This evolution has spurred significant industry activity, with companies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Ontotext acquiring companies to advance knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. The rise of GraphRAG has reignited interest in knowledge graphs, positioning them as critical components in AI systems, moving beyond metadata management to become the semantic backbone for AI applications.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/09/30/cyber_reiliance_act_opinion_column/">Greg Kroah-Hartman explains the Cyber Resilience Act for open source developers</a>: The European Union's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) mandates digital product producers to document vulnerabilities and respond to security incidents, impacting open-source software developers. Greg Kroah-Hartman, a Linux kernel maintainer, argues the CRA benefits open-source contributors by ensuring transparency and accountability. The CRA distinguishes between commercial entities and unpaid contributors, allowing individuals to publish software without legal risk. It applies to commercial manufacturers using open-source code, requiring Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and proactive incident management. While the CRA primarily affects EU-based manufacturers, its global reach extends to companies selling products accessible within the EU. The act is expected to increase demand for well-supported open-source projects, countering fears of reduced open-source use. Foundations and large projects are collaborating with the EU to simplify compliance through checklists and templates.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/brash_dos_attack_crashes_chromium/">This security hole can crash billions of Chromium browsers, and Google hasn't patched it yet</a>: Security researcher Jose Pino discovered a critical vulnerability in Chromium's Blink rendering engine, which can be exploited to crash many Chromium-based browsers within seconds. This flaw, known as Brash, affects over 3 billion users worldwide, as it can be used to crash browsers like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Vivaldi. Pino demonstrated the vulnerability by testing it on 11 major browsers, finding that it works on nine of them. The attack exploits an architectural flaw in Blink, specifically the absence of rate limiting on document.title API updates, allowing for millions of DOM mutations per second. This saturates the main thread, disrupting the event loop and causing the interface to collapse. Pino disclosed the issue to the Chromium security team, but did not receive a response.</li></ul>

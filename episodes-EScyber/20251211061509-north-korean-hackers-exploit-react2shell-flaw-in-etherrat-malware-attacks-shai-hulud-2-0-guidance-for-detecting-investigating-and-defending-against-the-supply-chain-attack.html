This attack, tracked as CVE-2025-55182, enables remote code execution via crafted HTTP requests, affecting numerous cloud environments running React/Next.js. Researchers at Sysdig discovered EtherRAT, which employs Ethereum smart contracts for command-and-control (C2) communication, multi-layered Linux persistence, and on-the-fly payload rewriting. The malware's advanced features include aggressive persistence mechanisms across five layers on Linux systems and the ability to self-update by sending its source code to an API endpoint. This self-updating capability helps evade static detection and may introduce mission-specific functionality. The attack chain begins with exploiting React2Shell to execute a base64-encoded shell command, followed by downloading and executing a malicious shell script. Automated exploitation led to breaches of at least 30 organizations across multiple sectors, resulting in credential theft, cryptomining, and the deployment of commodity backdoors.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/12/09/shai-hulud-2-0-guidance-for-detecting-investigating-and-defending-against-the-supply-chain-attack/">Shai-Hulud 2.0: Guidance for detecting, investigating, and defending against the supply chain attack</a>: The Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack is a significant cloud-native ecosystem compromise that targets developer environments, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-connected workloads. Attackers maliciously modified hundreds of publicly available packages, exploiting preinstall scripts to execute malicious code before security checks. This campaign builds on earlier supply chain compromises by introducing automation, faster propagation, and a broader target set, compromising maintainer accounts from widely used projects like Zapier and Postman. Stolen credentials are exfiltrated to public attacker-controlled repositories, posing a significant risk to organizations. To defend against threats like Shai-Hulud 2.0, organizations benefit from a layered protection approach from Microsoft Defender, which provides security coverage from code to runtime. This defense-in-depth approach is especially valuable when facing supply chain-driven attacks that might introduce malicious dependencies. Microsoft Defender recommends reviewing Key Vault assets, rotating exposed credentials, isolating affected CI/CD agents, and prioritizing high-risk attack paths to reduce further exposure.</li><li><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/prompt-injection-is-a-problem-that-may-never-be-fixed-warns-ncsc">Prompt injection is a problem that may never be fixed, warns NCSC</a>: Prompt injection, a persistent AI security issue, allows attackers to manipulate AI models by embedding malicious instructions within user input, bypassing safety mechanisms known as guardrails. This vulnerability poses significant risks, particularly as Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate autonomously, potentially leading to data breaches or fraud. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warns that prompt injection may never be fully resolved, unlike SQL injection, which has been effectively managed over the years. The NCSC emphasizes the need for careful design and implementation of AI systems to prevent such vulnerabilities, advising developers to limit AI agents' capabilities and monitor interactions closely. The potential impact of prompt injection is likened to past cybersecurity breaches, highlighting the urgent need for industry-wide improvements in AI security practices.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/10/microsoft_wont_fix_net_rce/">Microsoft won’t fix .NET RCE bug affecting slew of enterprise apps, researchers say</a>: Security researchers have revealed a .NET security flaw affecting a host of enterprise-grade products, which Microsoft refuses to fix. Piotr Bazydło, principal vulnerability researcher at watchTowr, unveiled the findings at Black Hat Europe, claiming that several vendor and in-house solutions could be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) attacks due to errors in the way applications built on Microsoft's .NET framework handle Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages. The researcher identified the SoapHttpClientProtocol class as the primary culprit, explaining that it can be exploited in different ways to achieve an attacker's goals. The class inherits from HttpWebClientProtocol, as do other client proxy types, but watchTowr highlighted SoapHttpClientProtocol as it is by far the most common across codebases. Bazydło said in a blog post shared with The Register before publication: "Its name and the official documentation both paint a simple picture: it should handle SOAP messages transported over HTTP. Straightforward. Predictable. Safe. Reality is less cooperative." The class is responsible for setting the target URL of the SOAP service and defining a SOAP method, but the vulnerability arises when attackers can manipulate that target URL and the way SoapHttpClientProtocol creates clients. Despite being designed to handle HTTP requests, SoapHttpClientProtocol uses a</li><li><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-google-chrome-ai-security/">Google Chrome’s New AI Security Aims to Stop Hackers Cold</a>: Google has announced a significant security overhaul for Chrome's AI-powered browsing features, designed to block indirect prompt injection attacks. This development addresses vulnerabilities flagged by security researchers, with Chrome controlling approximately 65% of the global browser market. The new system introduces the User Alignment Critic, an AI security guard that scrutinizes proposed actions without seeing actual web content, preventing manipulation. Google also implements Agent Origin Sets to restrict AI agents' access to certain web sections, requiring explicit user approval for sensitive actions. The company offers a $20,000 bounty for demonstrating successful breaches of these security measures, employing automated red-teaming systems to proactively identify weaknesses. These enhancements could set industry standards for AI agent protection, influencing how other companies approach AI safety.</li><li><a href="https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-intelligence/email-bombing-virtual-machine/">Beyond the bomb: When adversaries bring their own virtual machine for persistence</a>: Adversaries have been using spam bombing campaigns to gain initial access to compromised networks. In 2025, Red Canary Intelligence uncovered an interesting tactic: after a spam bombing attack, an adversary introduced their own virtual machine (VM) into a compromised environment and established persistence. This was the first time Red Canary Intelligence had detected an adversary bringing their own QEMU VM into an environment under the guise of a technical support call following a spam bombing attack. The adversary wasted no time after flooding the inbox, initiating a call to the organization posing as a technical support representative. Their offer was simple: help alleviate the deluge. After gaining the user’s confidence, the adversary leveraged remote assistance software Quick Assist. This legitimate, built-in Windows application allows a trusted person to take control of another computer remotely. While it can be used for support—like many remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools these days—it can be misused by threat actors to establish initial access and deploy malicious payloads. The adversary’s actions began with the execution of a Visual Basic Script (VBScript), Update.vbs. Due to Quick Assist’s nature of piggybacking on the user’s Explorer session, many of these initial actions appeared to originate from explorer.exe</li><li><a href="https://feeds.fortinet.com/~/932574884/0/fortinet/blog/threat-research~Uncovering-Hidden-Forensic-Evidence-in-Windows-The-Mystery-of-AutoLoggerDiagtrackListeneretl">Uncovering Hidden Forensic Evidence in Windows: The Mystery of AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl</a>: A recent FortiGuard IR services (FGIR) incident response engagement revealed that the threat actor used anti-forensic techniques to cover their tracks and avoid their malware getting into the hands of researchers. While analyzing a disk image of a compromised Windows Server 2016 system, FGIR was able to identify historical evidence of deleted malware and tools used by the threat actor, inside an obscure ETL file called AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl. ETL files are generated by the Windows ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) infrastructure. Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a built-in, high-performance logging framework that enables Windows and applications to record detailed events with minimal overhead. Instead of writing plain text logs, ETW uses providers such as the kernel, TCP/IP stack, or registry, which send structured event data into ETW sessions. These sessions can buffer the data for real-time consumption or write it to binary Event Trace Log (ETL) files. ETW involves three main roles: providers (sources of events), controllers (which start, stop, and manage sessions using tools like logman or PerfMon), and consumers (such as debuggers, Event Viewer, or EDRs, which process and interpret the data). This framework is powerful because it provides granular visibility into low-level OS activity (like process creation,</li></ul>

This method allows for the development of AI models that can perform multiple tasks efficiently. The technique is particularly useful in fields requiring diverse skill sets, such as healthcare and customer service. M2N2 leverages evolutionary algorithms to optimize model performance, making it a novel approach in AI development. The impact of this innovation is expected to be significant, as it could reduce costs and time associated with AI model development. This advancement marks a step forward in the field of AI, offering a more scalable and efficient solution for complex problem-solving tasks.</li><li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/opencuas-open-source-computer-use-agents-rival-proprietary-models-from-openai-and-anthropic/">OpenCUA’s open source computer-use agents rival proprietary models from OpenAI and Anthropic</a>: OpenCUA is an open-source framework that provides data and training recipes for building powerful computer-use agents. These agents challenge proprietary systems like those from OpenAI and Anthropic. The framework is designed to rival proprietary models in terms of capability and performance. Its open-source nature allows for greater accessibility and potential for innovation. The impact of OpenCUA could be significant in advancing AI capabilities and democratizing access to advanced AI technologies. The novelty of this framework lies in its open-source approach, which contrasts with the closed-source models of major AI companies.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-warns-of-new-ai-powered-malware-families-deployed-in-the-wild/">Google warns of new AI-powered malware families deployed in the wild</a>: Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has identified a major shift this year, with adversaries leveraging artificial intelligence to deploy new malware families that integrate large language models (LLMs) during execution. This new approach enables dynamic altering mid-execution, which reaches new levels of operational versatility that are virtually impossible to achieve with traditional malware. Google calls the technique "just-in-time" self-modification and highlights the experimental PromptFlux malware dropper and the PromptSteal (a.k.a. LameHug) data miner deployed in Ukraine, as examples for dynamic script generation, code obfuscation, and creation of on-demand functions. PromptFlux is an experimental VBScript dropper that leverages Google's LLM Gemini in its latest version to generate obfuscated VBScript variants. It attempts persistence via Startup folder entries, and spreads laterally on removable drives and mapped network shares. "The most novel component of PROMPTFLUX is its 'Thinking Robot' module, designed to periodically query Gemini to obtain new code for evading antivirus software," explains Google. The prompt is very specific and machine-parsable, according to the researchers, who see indications that the malware's creators aim to create an ever-evolving "metamorphic script." PromptFlux "StartThinkingRobot" functionSource: Google Google could not attribute PromptFlux to a specific threat actor, but noted that the tactics, techniques, and procedures indicate</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/your-credit-risk-model-works-today-it-breaks-in-six-months/">What to Do When Your Credit Risk Model Works Today, but Breaks Six Months Later</a>: A study reveals that gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost) fail to maintain ranking stability over time, leading to significant accuracy degradation in credit risk models. The research identifies that the geometry of optimization, rather than data or hyperparameters, is crucial for maintaining model stability. By adopting a Hamiltonian framework for neural network training, the study demonstrates improved temporal stability, with AUC scores dropping only 10.6 points over six years compared to XGBoost's 32 points. This approach preserves relative orderings, crucial for ranking tasks like credit risk assessment. The findings suggest that optimizing models on symplectic manifolds can enhance stability, offering broader applicability across systems requiring ranking, such as medical risk stratification and fraud detection.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/russian_spies_pack_custom_malware/">Russian spies pack custom malware into hidden VMs on Windows machines</a>: Russian spies, known as Curly COMrades, are exploiting Microsoft's Hyper-V hypervisor to create hidden virtual machines (VMs) on compromised Windows machines. This technique allows them to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, providing long-term network access for surveillance and malware deployment. The attackers use a lightweight Alpine Linux-based VM to host custom malware, including CurlyShell and CurlCat, which are designed to evade detection and maintain persistence. This campaign, which began in July, has targeted judicial and government bodies in Georgia and an energy company in Moldova, with Bitdefender tracking the group since 2024. The sophistication of this approach highlights a growing trend of threat actors bypassing EDR solutions by leveraging legitimate virtualization technologies. To counter this, experts recommend a multi-layered defense strategy beyond endpoint detection.</li></ul>

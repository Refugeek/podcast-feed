It modifies the attention mechanism in transformers by applying rotations to query and key projections, allowing for better handling of relative positions between tokens. This approach preserves semantic information while enabling models to focus on nearby tokens with higher attention weights and distant tokens with lower weights. RoPE addresses challenges faced by traditional positional embeddings, such as overfitting and deterioration in sequence length generalization. By isolating position information into the attention mechanism, RoPE maintains a focus on semantics and effectively mitigates issues like local maxima and overfitting risks. This innovation enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by improving their ability to capture nuanced language dependencies across varying distances.</li><li><a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/dynowiper-update-technical-analysis-attribution/">DynoWiper update: Technical analysis and attribution</a>: ESET researchers identified a new data-wiping malware named DynoWiper, used against an energy company in Poland. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed during the DynoWiper incident closely resemble those seen earlier this year in an incident involving the ZOV wiper in Ukraine. ESET attributes DynoWiper to Sandworm with medium confidence, in contrast to the ZOV wiper, which ESET attributes to Sandworm with high confidence. Sandworm is a Russia-aligned threat group that performs destructive attacks. It is mostly known for its attacks against Ukrainian energy companies in 2015-12 and 2016-12, which resulted in power outages. In 2017-06, Sandworm launched the NotPetya data-wiping attack that used a supply-chain vector by compromising the Ukrainian accounting software M.E.Doc. In 2018-02, Sandworm launched the Olympic Destroyer data-wiping attack against organizers of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The Sandworm group uses such advanced malware as Industroyer, which is able to communicate with equipment at energy companies via industrial control protocols. In 2022-04, CERT-UA thwarted an attack against an energy company in Ukraine where the Sandworm group tried to deploy a new variant of this malware, Industroyer2. In 2020-10, the US Department of Justice published an indictment against six Russian computer hackers that it</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/cyberattack_poland_power_grid/">Cyberattack on Poland's power grid could have turned deadly in winter cold</a>: Cyberattack on Poland's power grid could have turned deadly in winter cold. Cybersecurity experts involved in the cleanup of the cyberattacks on Poland's power network say the consequences could have been lethal. In a report published this week, Dragos said it is working with one of the 30 or so facilities affected by the attacks, allegedly carried out by Russian intelligence. It called the attacks irresponsible, and if they succeeded in disrupting the country's power grid, it could have led to civilian deaths given the timing. Dragos, which attributed the attacks to the group it calls Electrum but most others call Sandworm, described the attacks as a world-first for targeting distributed energy sources (DERs), which are smaller sites connected to a country's central power grid. The attacks bore similarities with those carried out by Russia a decade ago in Ukraine, where GRU-affiliated Sandworm attackers compromised the country's power grid. The use of wiper malware, DynoWiper in this case, is consistent with Sandworm's previous attacks on critical infrastructure, but targeting DERs is an evolution in tradecraft. Dragos said the various compromises in Poland show these DERs, which don't often receive the same levels of cybersecurity investment as centralized facilities, now represent</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/google_windows_admin_exploit/">Old Windows quirks help punch through new admin defenses</a>: Microsoft patched vulnerabilities in Windows Administrator Protection, which allows users to elevate privileges to admin level only when necessary. James Forshaw, a security researcher at Google's Project Zero, reported nine vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to silently grant themselves admin privileges on machines with Administrator Protection enabled. Forshaw discovered a Logon Sessions flaw that relied on five different Windows behaviors, specifically how Windows handles DOS device object directories for specific user sessions. The flaw focused on how Windows handles these directories for specific user sessions. Forshaw demonstrated that attackers can modify the token's owner security identifier to match their own user ID, effectively being able to control it. Microsoft fixed this by preventing DOS device object directory creation when impersonating a shadow admin token at the identification level.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-hijack-exposed-llm-endpoints-in-bizarre-bazaar-operation/">Hackers hijack exposed LLM endpoints in Bizarre Bazaar operation</a>: Researchers at Pillar Security have identified a cybercrime operation dubbed "Bizarre Bazaar," which exploits LLM (Large Language Model) service endpoints to steal computing resources, resell API access, and exfiltrate data. The campaign, which has been active for over 40 days, involves three threat actors who use bots to scan the internet for LLM and MCP endpoints, validate findings, and operate a commercial service called SilverInc, which resells access in exchange for cryptocurrency or PayPal payments. The attacks target misconfigured LLM endpoints, exposing sensitive organizational data and providing lateral movement opportunities. The campaign is one of the first examples of LLMjacking attacks attributed to a specific threat actor. As of writing, the campaign is ongoing, and the SilverInc service continues to be operational.</li></ul>

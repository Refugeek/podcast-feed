The driver's design allows for a powerful local privilege escalation bug, enabling arbitrary read/write on the Pixel 9. This exploit chain exploits a bug in the BigWave driver's handling of ioctl BIGO_IOCX_PROCESS, which can lead to a race condition where a job is dequeued prematurely, allowing an attacker to control the destination of writes to kernel memory. This control enables arbitrary writes to kernel .data, bypassing KASLR and allowing for complete kernel privilege escalation. The exploit chain is notable for its simplicity and effectiveness, requiring no user interaction or additional exploits to achieve full kernel control.</li><li><a href="https://projectzero.google/2026/01/pixel-0-click-part-1.html">A 0-click exploit chain for the Pixel 9 Part 1: Decoding Dolby</a>: Researchers at Project Zero have identified vulnerabilities in the Dolby Unified Decoder (UDC) on Android devices, particularly affecting Pixel 9 models. These vulnerabilities allow for 0-click exploits, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code without user interaction. The researchers reported two critical CVEs: CVE-2025-54957 and CVE-2025-36934, which allow for code execution in the mediacodec context. These vulnerabilities exploit a flaw in memory allocation within the evo heap used for processing EMDF payloads, leading to potential integer overflow issues. The findings highlight the need for improved security measures in media decoding components on mobile devices. The vulnerabilities have been fixed as of January 5, 2026, and the research aims to inform defenders about these attack vectors and the importance of addressing such vulnerabilities.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/stackwarp_bug_amd_cpus/">Flipping one bit leaves AMD CPUs open to VM vuln</a>: Researchers affiliated with the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Germany have discovered a vulnerability in AMD CPUs that could allow malicious insiders to access sensitive data in AMD SEV-SNP virtual machines. The flaw, dubbed StackWarp, exploits a microarchitecture designed to accelerate stack operations and can be exploited via a previously undocumented control bit on the hypervisor side. The attack scenario applies to AMD SEV-SNP, a successor to AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) and SEV-ES (Encrypted State), when Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) has been enabled. Researchers Ruiyi Zhang, Tristan Hornetz, Daniel Weber, Fabian Thomas, and Michael Schwarz report that they were able to abuse the stack engine on AMD Zen CPUs in a way that breaks CVMs. They describe their findings in a paper titled, "StackWarp: Breaking AMD SEV-SNP Integrity via Deterministic Stack-Pointer Manipulation through the CPU's Stack Engine." The paper is scheduled for publication at USENIX Security 2026.</li></ul>

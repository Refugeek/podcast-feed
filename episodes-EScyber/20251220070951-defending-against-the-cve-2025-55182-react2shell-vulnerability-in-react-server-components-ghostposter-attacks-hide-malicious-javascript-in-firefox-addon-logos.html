With a CVSS score of 10.0, this vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers through a single malicious HTTP request. Exploitation activity related to this vulnerability was detected as early as December 5, 2025. Most successful exploits originated from red team assessments; however, we also observed real-world exploitation attempts by threat actors delivering multiple subsequent payloads, majority of which are coin miners. Both Windows and Linux environments have been observed to be impacted. The React Server Components ecosystem is a collection of packages, frameworks, and bundlers that enable React 19 applications to run parts of their logic on the server rather than the browser. It uses the Flight protocol to communicate between client and server. When a client requests data, the server receives a payload, parses this payload, executes server-side logic, and returns a serialized component tree. The vulnerability exists because affected React Server Components versions fail to validate incoming payloads. This could allow attackers to inject malicious structures that React accepts as valid, leading to prototype pollution and remote code execution. This vulnerability presents a</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ghostposter-attacks-hide-malicious-javascript-in-firefox-addon-logos/">GhostPoster attacks hide malicious JavaScript in Firefox addon logos</a>: The GhostPoster campaign is a new attack that hides malicious JavaScript code in the image logos of over 50,000 popular Firefox extensions. The hidden script is acting as a loader that fetches the main payload from a remote server. Koi Security researchers discovered the GhostPoster campaign and identified 17 compromised Firefox extensions that either read the PNG logo to extract and execute the malware loader or download the main payload from the attacker's server. The malicious extensions are from popular categories: free-vpn-forever screenshot-saved-easy weather-best-forecast crxmouse-gesture cache-fast-site-loader freemp3downloader google-translate-right-clicks google-traductor-esp world-wide-vpn dark-reader-for-ff translator-gbbd i-like-weather google-translate-pro-extension 谷歌-翻译 libretv-watch-free-videos ad-stop right-click-google-translate The JavaScript loader activates 48 hours later to fetch a payload from a hardcoded domain. A second backup domain is available if the payload is not retrieved from the first one. The final payload has the following capabilities: Hijacks affiliate links on major e-commerce sites, redirecting commissions to the attackers. Injects Google Analytics tracking into every page the user visits. Strips security headers from all HTTP responses. Bypasses CAPTCHA via three distinct mechanisms to circumvent bot protections. Injects invisible iframes for ad fraud, click fraud,</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/chrome_edge_privacy_extensions_quietly/">Browser 'privacy' extensions have eye on your AI, log all your chats</a>: Four popular browser extensions have been harvesting the text of chatbot conversations from over 8 million people and sending them back to the developers. The four extensions are Urban VPN Proxy, 1ClickVPN Proxy, Urban Browser Guard, and Urban Ad Blocker. They are distributed via the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons. The extensions include code designed to capture and transmit browser-based interactions with popular AI tools. Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI. The research firm said that the platforms targeted include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI. The extension monitors the user's browser tabs and, when the user visits one of the targeted platforms, it injects the "executor" script into the page. The script overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest – the fundamental browser APIs that handle all network requests. The script parses the intercepted API responses and then packages and transmits the data via window.postMessage to the extension's content script, along with the identifier PANELOS_MESSAGE. The content script then passes the data to a background service worker for exfiltration over the network to endpoints at analytics.urban-vpn.com and stats.urban-vpn.com.</li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/prompt-injection-attacks-uk-intelligence-warning">UK intelligence warns AI 'prompt injection' attacks might never go away</a>: The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warns that prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs) may never be fully mitigated. Prompt injection attacks manipulate AI systems into ignoring their original instructions by confusing user content with commands. Examples include Microsoft’s New Bing search engine and GitHub’s Copilot. The NCSC’s technical director for platforms research, David C, warns that embedding generative AI into digital systems globally could trigger a wave of security breaches worldwide. Researchers are attempting to develop methods to mitigate these attacks by detecting prompts or training models to differentiate instructions and data. However, all approaches are trying to overlay a concept of “instruction” and “data” on a technology that inherently does not distinguish between the two. The better approach would be to stop considering prompt injection as a form of code injection and instead to view it as what security researchers call a “Confused Deputy” vulnerability.</li></ul>

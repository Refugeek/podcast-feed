It evaluates the ratio of constraints verified by tools versus those inferred by the LLM. The method involves calculating the bits of information defined as "-log2(p)" bits, where p is the surviving fraction of information from constraints applied. Prompt Fidelity ranges from 0 to 1, with 1.0 indicating every part of the request was backed by real data and 0.0 meaning the output was driven entirely by the agent's reasoning. The impact of Prompt Fidelity is significant as it highlights the gap between user intent and AI execution, emphasizing the limitations of AI agents in handling complex requests. The novelty lies in its ability to quantify and report the compression ratio of user input used by AI agents, providing insights into the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated outputs.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/edr-email-and-sase-miss-this-entire-class-of-browser-attacks/">EDR, Email, and SASE Miss This Entire Class of Browser Attacks</a>: ### **Browser Attacks** Browser attacks exploit the growing disconnect between security architectures and the browser, a central point of failure for attackers. This class of modern attacks is difficult to deal with because multiple attack types all collapse into the same visibility gap. Common browser-based attack types include ClickFix, UI-Driven Social Engineering, malicious extensions, man-in-the-browser (AITB, BitB, etc.), and HTML smuggling. This isn't a failure of tools or teams, but a consequence of what these systems were designed to see, and what they were not. EDR focuses on processes, files, and memory on the endpoint. Email security tracks delivery, links, and attachments. SASE and proxy technologies enforce policy on traffic moving across the network. Each can block known bad activity, but none are built to understand user interaction inside the browser itself. AI tools and AI-native browsers are widening the gap by increasing the volume and subtlety of browser-based data movement. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini normalize copying, pasting, uploading, and summarizing sensitive information directly in the browser. AI-native browsers, built-in assistants, and extensions streamline these actions even further. From a control standpoint, much of this activity appears legitimate. From a prevention standpoint, it’s difficult to evaluate risk without</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/openclaw_skills_marketplace_leaky_security/">OpenClaw reveals meaty personal information after simple cracks</a>: Researchers have disclosed vulnerabilities in OpenClaw, a previously insecure AI agent farm. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to backdoor users' machines, steal sensitive data, and perform destructive operations. The flaws are due to indirect prompt injection, enabling attackers to manipulate AI agents to mishandle secrets and expose sensitive credentials. The SKILL.md instructions and treating AI agents like local scripts are the main causes of these flaws. The vulnerabilities can be exploited through integrations with other productivity tools like Google Workspace and Slack, allowing attackers to access email, calendars, documents, and enterprise Slack chats. The impact of these vulnerabilities is significant, as they can enable financial fraud, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities. The novelty of these vulnerabilities lies in their ability to exploit AI agents' integrations with other tools, making them a potential threat to organizations and individuals alike.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/edr-killer-tool-uses-signed-kernel-driver-from-forensic-software/">EDR killer tool uses signed kernel driver from forensic software</a>: Hackers are exploiting a revoked EnCase kernel driver to create a custom EDR killer, which can disable 59 security tools. This technique, known as 'Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver' (BYOVD), uses a legitimate but outdated driver to gain kernel-level access. The attack was detected after attackers breached a network using compromised credentials and performed reconnaissance activities. The EDR killer targets processes related to EDR and antivirus tools, bypassing Windows protections like Protected Process Light (PPL). Despite Microsoft's defenses, the driver's certificate is still accepted due to a loophole in Windows' certificate validation system. The intrusion was likely related to ransomware, but was stopped before payload deployment.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/autonomous_cyberattacks_not_real_yet/">AI agents can't yet pull off fully autonomous cyberattacks - but they are already very helpful to crims</a>: AI systems can assist criminals in many stages of cyberattacks, according to the International AI Safety report. The report, chaired by Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio and authored by over 100 experts across 30 countries, found that AI developers have vastly improved their ability to help automate and perpetrate cyberattacks. The report cites a November 2025 report by Anthropic, which found Chinese cyberspies abusing its Claude Code AI tool to automate most elements of attacks directed at around 30 high-profile companies and government organizations. The report also cites DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), a two-year competition in which teams built AI models to find vulnerabilities in open-source software that undergirds critical infrastructure. Finalist systems autonomously identified 77 percent of the synthetic vulnerabilities used in the final scoring round. The report warns that AI-powered cyberattack kits are 'just a matter of time.'</li></ul>

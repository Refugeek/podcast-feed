On November 10, 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added CVE-2025-21042 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, signaling active exploitation. This vulnerability, an out-of-bounds write flaw in Samsung's image processing library, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining complete control over the device without user interaction. Exploited as a remote code execution (RCE) zero-day, attackers deployed LANDFALL spyware on Galaxy devices in the Middle East using malformed Digital Negative (DNG) image files sent via WhatsApp. This attack chain is a "zero-click" attack, requiring no user action to compromise the device. Samsung patched the issue in April 2025, but CISA's warning highlights ongoing exploits, emphasizing the need for urgent patching and enhanced security measures.</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/13/synnovis_qilin_investigation/">NHS supplier ends probe into ransomware attack that contributed to patient death</a>: Synnovis, a major NHS supplier, has concluded its 18-month investigation into a 2024 ransomware attack that disrupted pathology services across London. The Qilin ransomware gang, believed to be of Russian origin, claimed responsibility for the attack, which led to the cancellation of thousands of appointments and operations. The investigation revealed that the compromised data was unstructured and fragmented, posing a significant challenge for forensic teams. Security firm CaseMatrix estimated that over 900,000 NHS patient records were leaked, though Synnovis has not confirmed this figure. Notably, the disruption contributed to a patient's death, marking a rare instance of a ransomware incident linked to a fatality. Synnovis has not paid a ransom, citing ethical principles and rejecting funding for cybercriminal activities. The company has replaced all affected infrastructure and will notify NHS organizations by November 21, though individual patient notifications may take longer.</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/anthropic-claims-of-claude-ai-automated-cyberattacks-met-with-doubt/">Anthropic claims of Claude AI-automated cyberattacks met with doubt</a>: Anthropic reports that a Chinese state-sponsored threat group, tracked as GTG-1002, carried out a cyber-espionage operation that was largely automated through the abuse of the company's Claude Code AI model. [...]</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/12/cverc_prince_grou_scam_bitcoin/">China hates crypto and scams, but is now outraged USA acquired bitcoin from a scammer</a>: A new theory from the agency that brought us ‘America hacked itself to blame Beijing’ China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) has alleged a nation-state entity, probably the USA, was behind a 2020 attack on a bitcoin mining operation and by doing so has gone into bat for entities that Beijing usually blasts.…</li><li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/11/eu_leaked_gdpr_ai_reforms/">EU's reforms of GDPR, AI slated by privacy activists for 'playing into Big Tech’s hands'</a>: The European Commission plans to overhaul digital privacy legislation with the "Digital Omnibus" package, introducing amendments to AI regulation, cybersecurity, data protection, and privacy. Critics, including privacy group Noyb, argue these changes could undermine existing rules, benefiting Big Tech at the expense of user privacy. Proposed amendments include a loophole in GDPR that might allow companies to use personal data more freely for commercial purposes, weaken data access rights, and weaken protections for sensitive data. The EC claims these reforms aim to alleviate administrative burdens on small businesses, but critics see it as a distraction from the real issues. The proposals could influence U.S. tech policy, similar to how GDPR inspired the California Consumer Privacy Act. AI reforms are also under scrutiny, with concerns about granting AI systems special exemptions that could privilege risky technologies over others.</li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-agents-with-gpt-5/">How to Build Agents with GPT-5</a>: OpenAI's GPT-5 model is being utilized to develop AI agents capable of answering user queries by accessing internal knowledge bases and utilizing various tools. This approach enhances the model's ability to automate workflows and improve data management processes. The method involves integrating GPT-5 with tools from OpenAI's ecosystem, such as vector storage and custom tools, to enable efficient data retrieval and user interaction. The impact of this development is significant, as it positions GPT-5 as a fundamental component in modern AI applications, driving innovation in information access and processing. Additionally, the novelty lies in the seamless integration of diverse tools within the GPT-5 framework, offering a flexible and powerful solution for complex AI tasks.</li></ul>
